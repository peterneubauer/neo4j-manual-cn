[[cookbook-complete-graph]]
== Complete graph ==
For this graph, a root node is created, and used to hang a number 
        of nodes from. Then, two nodes are selected, hanging from the center, with the requirement that the 
        id of the first is less than the id of the next. This is to prevent double relationships and 
        self relationships. Using said match, relationships between all these nodes are created. Lastly, 
        the center node and all relationships connected to it are removed.
