[[match-optional-relationship]]
== Optional relationship ==
If a relationship is optional, it can be marked with a question mark. This is similar to how a SQL outer join works. If the relationship is there, it is returned. If it's not, +null+ is returned in it's place. Remember that anything hanging off an optional relationship, is in turn optional, unless it is connected with a bound node through some other path.

A node, and +null+ are returned, since the node has no outgoing relationships.
