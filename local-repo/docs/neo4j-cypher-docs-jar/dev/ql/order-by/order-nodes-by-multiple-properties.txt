== Order nodes by multiple properties ==
You can order by multiple properties by stating each identifier in the +ORDER BY+ clause. Cypher will sort the result by the first identifier listed, and for equals values, go to the next property in the `ORDER BY` clause, and so on.

[source,cypher]
----
START n=node(3,1,2)
RETURN n
ORDER BY n.age, n.name
----


This returns the nodes, sorted first by their age, and then by their name.
