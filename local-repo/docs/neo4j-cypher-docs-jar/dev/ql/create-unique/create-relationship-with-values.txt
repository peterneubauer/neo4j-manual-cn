START root=node(2)
CREATE UNIQUE root-[r:X {since:'forever'}]-()
RETURN r
----


In this example, we want the relationship to have a value, and since no such relationship can be found, a new node and relationship are created. Note that since we are not interested in the created node, we don't name it.
