[[where-filtering-on-relationship-type]]
== Filtering on relationship type ==
You can put the exact relationship type in the `MATCH` pattern, but sometimes you want to be able to do more advanced filtering on the type. You can use the special property `TYPE` to compare the type with something else. In this example, the query does a regular expression comparison with the name of the relationship type.
