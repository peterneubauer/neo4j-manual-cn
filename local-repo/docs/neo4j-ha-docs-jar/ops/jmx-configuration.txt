|remote_shell_read_only|Configuration attribute|String|yes|yes
|store_dir|The directory where the database files are located.|String|yes|yes
|string_block_size|Specifies the block size for storing strings. This parameter is only honored when the store is created, otherwise it is ignored. Note that each character in a string occupies two bytes, meaning that a block size of 120 (the default size) will hold a 60 character long string before overflowing into a second block. Also note that each block carries an overhead of 8 bytes. This means that if the block size is 120, the size of the stored records will be 128 bytes.. 1 < string_block_size|String|yes|yes
|use_memory_mapped_buffers|Tell Neo4j to use memory mapped buffers for accessing the native storage layer.|String|yes|yes
