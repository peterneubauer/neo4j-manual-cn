Hello world Sample Chapter
==========================

This is a sample documentation test, demonstrating different ways of
bringing code and other artifacts into Asciidoc form. The title of the 
generated document is determined from the method name, replacing "+_+" with
" ".

Below you see a number of different ways to generate text from source,
inserting it into the JavaDoc documentation (really being Asciidoc markup)
via the +@@+ snippet markers and programmatic adding with runtime data
in the Java code.

- The annotated graph as http://www.graphviz.org/[GraphViz]-generated visualization:

.Hello World Graph
["dot", "Hello-World-Graph-hello-world-Sample-Chapter.svg", "neoviz", ""]
----
  N1 [
    label = "{Node\[1\]|name = \'you\'\l}"
  ]
  N2 [
    label = "{Node\[2\]|name = \'I\'\l}"
  ]
  N2 -> N1 [
    color = "#2e3436"
    fontcolor = "#2e3436"
    label = "know\n"
  ]

START n = node(2)
RETURN n
